Omegon's Wrath Fan Codex Homebrew Catalogue for the Warhammer 40,000 data sets.
==================

These files are based on @Cerxis's Fan codex below:

[Fan Codex - Omegon's Wrath](https://www.cerxis.de/omegonswrath/index.php/supplement/)

---------------------
To use these files, first download the relevant 40k data set within Battlescribe.

Next, download the .cat file(s) you want from here.

You then need to manually copy the file into your Battlescribe data directory.

On Windows, that is "%userprofile%\Battlescribe\data\Warhammer 40,000 9th Edition" by default.

Once the file is in that directory, you should see the new catalogue as a choice when you go to create a new Roster.
